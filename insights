OBJECTIVE: The objective of road accident analysis is to prevent accidents, reduce injuries and fatalities, 
and create safer road environments for all road users. By identifying trends, understanding causes, and 
implementing targeted interventions, road accident analysis plays a crucial role in improving road safety and saving lives.
To Create a dashboard for  year 2021  and 2022 so that they can have insights of the road accident and 
to gain insights into the causes, patterns, and trends of road accidents in order to:
1.	Improve Road Safety
2.	Identify High-Risk Groups:
3.	Evaluate and Improve Road Infrastructure
•	Performed  data cleaning , data processing, analysing, dashboarding
•	Tools and technology used: MS excel

Based on the provided data, we can draw the following insights and conclusions:
1.	Severity of Casualties: The data reveals a total of 417,883 casualties, including 7,135 fatal casualties, 59,312 serious casualties, 
and 351,436 slight casualties. This indicates the need for proactive measures to reduce the severity of accidents and enhance road safety
interventions to minimize fatal and serious injuries.
2.	Car Accidents: The majority of casualties, approximately 79.3%, are caused by car accidents. This insight highlights the significance
of addressing factors related to car safety, driver behavior, and enforcement measures to reduce the number of car-related casualties on the roads.
3.	Road Type and Casualties: The data indicates that single roads have a higher number of casualties compared to other road types. This insight
emphasizes the importance of improving infrastructure, implementing safety measures, and enhancing driver awareness on single roads to mitigate
accidents and casualties.
4.	Road Surface and Casualties: The data shows that dry roads are associated with more casualties. This insight suggests the need for increased
awareness and appropriate road maintenance practices during dry conditions to reduce accidents and enhance road safety.
5.	Time of Day and Location: The majority of casualties occur during daylight hours and in urban areas. This insight highlights the importance of
targeted road safety measures in urban environments, such as improved pedestrian infrastructure, traffic management, and driver education to address
the specific challenges and risks associated with urban driving.
Overall, these insights underscore the importance of comprehensive road safety strategies that encompass multiple factors.
It is crucial to address driver behavior, vehicle safety, road infrastructure, and environmental conditions to minimize casualties.
By implementing appropriate interventions and measures based on these insights, it is possible to reduce the number of accidents, 
severity of casualties, and improve overall road safety for all road users.
